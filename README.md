# YAWN - Yet Another Whisper traNscriber

Just a small afternoon project using [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/), [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard) in order to transcribe speech at the press of a button.

## Use
1. Keep the hotkey (`scroll lock` by default) pressed to record your voice.
2. Let go to let Whisper transcribe it.
3. The output is written to whatever application you have open at the time.
